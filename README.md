# Search Engine

Project designed and implemented by **Santiago Fernández González**.

The aim of this project is implementing a search engine that works over texts. For this purpose I have used **Elasticsearch**, that is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine through RESTful APIs and JSON.
